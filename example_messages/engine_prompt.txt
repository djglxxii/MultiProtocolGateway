We need to work on this project on the 'dev' branch.  We need to rethink the way we're handling sending out messages when handlers call 'SendAsync'.  The way I would like for this to work is that each handler will SendAsync all messages that are their responsbility. For example, we migth have an OperatorsHandler and PatientsHandler that will queue up a bunch of operators and patient update messages respectively.  However, the engine should not just spam them all out.  On each message send we need to wait for an acknowledgement before proceeding to the next.  Additionally, if the medical device responds back with an NAK (an ackcode of 'AE') then we need some way to telling the appropriate handler that there was an error so it can do some house cleaning with whatever they were trying to send.  Recall that each ACK has an <ACK.ack_control_id V="237888" /> which references the control id of the message it's ack'ing, so in theory we could track which ack belongs to which handler (unless you can think of a better way).  Let's talk about this before writing any code.
